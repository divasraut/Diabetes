# Diabetes
This notebook focuses on Diabetes Prediction using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.
Summary of Steps
Loaded the diabetes dataset.

Checked for missing values and feature correlations.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Trained a Decision Tree model for classification.

Evaluated the Decision Tree model’s accuracy.

Trained a Random Forest model for comparison.

Evaluated the Random Forest model’s accuracy.

Final Thoughts
This project aims to predict diabetes using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers. The Random Forest model is likely to perform better because it reduces overfitting compared to a single Decision Tree.
